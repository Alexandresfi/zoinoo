Zainoo Project.
This project was based on Figma(https://www.figma.com/file/FZxssyUrRRQDIolKs28qhO/Zainoo---Shoe-Website-Template?node-id=0%3A1), 
where I used HTML and CSS, in order to improving my skills in CSS, in this project I was able to manipulate the position property
more effectively and to use multiple fonts in the same project, and in addition, I was able to improve my knowledge of Figma.
